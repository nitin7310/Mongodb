        "- Data model → SQL uses structured, tabular data; NoSQL uses flexible formats like JSON, key-value, graph, or column-family.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Schema → SQL has a fixed, predefined schema; NoSQL allows dynamic and flexible schemas.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Relationships → SQL supports joins and relations; NoSQL relies on denormalization or embedded documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Query language → SQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL); NoSQL uses varied query syntaxes based on the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Scalability → SQL typically scales vertically (stronger hardware); NoSQL scales horizontally (distributed architecture).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Consistency → SQL follows ACID properties (strong consistency); NoSQL often follows BASE (eventual consistency).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Transactions → SQL excels at complex multi-step transactions; NoSQL may support limited or eventual transactional models.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Performance → SQL is optimized for complex queries; NoSQL shines with large volumes of fast-changing data.\n",

        "Q3. Explain the concept of collections in MongoDB\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->>\n",
        "- A collection stores multiple documents, where each document is a JSON-like object (called BSON internally).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Collections do not require a fixed schema, so documents within the same collection can have different fields and data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Collections are created inside a database and can be created explicitly or automatically when you insert data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4.How does MongoDB ensure high availability using replication?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> MongoDB ensures high availability through a robust replication mechanism called replica sets, which provide redundancy, fault tolerance, and automatic failover\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What are the main benefits of MongoDB Atlas?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> MongoDB Atlas offers a powerful suite of features that make it a top choice for modern cloud-based applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6.What is the role of indexes in MongoDB, and how do they improve performance?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> Indexes in MongoDB play a crucial role in boosting query performance and ensuring efficient data retrieval. Think of them like the index in a book — instead of flipping through every page, you jump straight to the info you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "->> How Indexes Work Internally\n",
        "\n",
        "- MongoDB uses B-tree data structures to store indexes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- These trees keep data sorted and balanced, allowing logarithmic-time lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "- When a document is inserted, updated, or deleted, MongoDB updates all relevant indexes — which is why too many indexes can slow down writes\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7.Describe the stages of the MongoDB aggregation pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> Common Aggregation Pipeline Stages\n",
        "- $match Filters documents based on specified criteria, similar to a SQL WHERE clause. Example: Select orders where status = \"shipped\".\n",
        "\n",
        "- $project Reshapes documents by including, excluding, or computing new fields. Example: Show only name and total, and hide _id.\n",
        "\n",
        "- $group Groups documents by a field and performs aggregation operations like sum, avg, max, etc. Example: Group sales by region and calculate total revenue.\n",
        "\n",
        "- $sort Sorts documents by one or more fields in ascending (1) or descending (-1) order. Example: Sort products by price descending.\n",
        "\n",
        "- $limit Restricts the number of documents passed to the next stage. Example: Return only the top 5 results.\n",
        "\n",
        "- $skip Skips a specified number of documents. Example: Skip the first 10 documents for pagination.\n",
        "\n",
        "- $unwind Deconstructs an array field into multiple documents, one per array element. Example: Break down a tags array into individual tag documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is sharding in MongoDB? How does it differ from replication?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> Sharding is MongoDB’s method of horizontal scaling. It splits large datasets into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards, which are distributed across multiple servers\n",
        "\n",
        "->> Diffrance\n",
        "\n",
        "- Purpose → Sharding enables horizontal scaling; replication ensures high availability and fault tolerance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data distribution → Sharding splits data across multiple servers; replication duplicates the same data across servers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Write operations → Sharding distributes writes across shards; replication writes only to the primary node.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Read operations → Sharding routes reads based on shard key; replication allows reads from secondary nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Failure handling → Sharding doesn’t handle failover; replication promotes a secondary to primary if the primary fails.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9.What is PyMongo, and why is it used?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> PyMongo is the official Python driver for MongoDB, designed to let Python applications interact seamlessly with MongoDB databases\n",
        "\n",
        "->>Why\n",
        "\n",
        "- Simplicity: Easy to learn and use, especially for Python developers.\n",
        "\n",
        " Performance: Efficient for synchronous operations and optimized for production use.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Compatibility: Works with all major MongoDB versions and integrates well with MongoDB Atlas.\n",

        "\n",
        "  ->>\n",
        "- Role → Primary handles writes; secondary replicates data from the primary.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Write operations → Only the primary accepts writes; secondaries do not.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Read operations → Primary serves reads by default; secondaries can serve reads if configured.\n",
        "\n",
        " Data sync → Primary logs changes in the oplog; secondaries apply those changes asynchronously.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Failover → If the primary fails, a secondary is elected to become the new primary.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Election participation → Both can participate in elections; only one node is primary at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data consistency → Primary is the source of truth; secondaries mirror its state.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Availability → Primary is critical for writes; secondaries ensure redundancy and read scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Recovery → A failed secondary rejoins and resyncs; a failed primary triggers an election.\n",
        "\n",

        "- An embedded document is a field whose value is itself a document.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This structure mimics real-world relationships — for example, a user document might contain an embedded address document.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ When to Use Embedded Documents\n",
        "- One-to-One or One-to-Few Relationships If the related data is tightly coupled and doesn’t grow unbounded — like a user’s profile or a product’s manufacturer details.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Frequent Joint Access When you often retrieve the parent and child data together, embedding reduces the need for multiple queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Atomic Updates Embedded documents allow updates to both parent and child data in a single atomic operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Rare Updates to Subdocuments If the embedded data doesn’t change often, embedding avoids the overhead of syncing separate collections.\n",
